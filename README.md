# Assignment-2

## What is this repository for?
This repository is for the major group work for Statistical Thinking for Data Science for the Master of Data Science & Innovation at UTS. All group members should be able to contribute to the assignment through the repository.


## Getting Started
Since the course is primarily using R as the programming language, unless otherwise practical, all group members should be using R version 3.4.4. Other programming languages may be used (especially in the data collection phase) as some APIs will not interact with R, but will interact with Java or Python. 

### Group Members
* Mark 
* Danny

* Justin 
* Mary-Alice

### Use of Wiki
A wiki for this project has been set up to share knowledge across the group. All group members are expected to contribute to the wiki to produce documentation for the project including meeting minutes, discussion topics, code snippets and documentation and key milestones/decisions.

### Project Management & Communication
Communication will be conducted through student email, a private slack channel for the group, and in person. If you do not have access to the group slack channel or student email, consult another group member. The group is yet to decide on how project management will take place.
