# Assignment-2

## What is this repository for?
This repository is for the major group work for Statistical Thinking for Data Science for the Master of Data Science & Innovation at UTS. All group members should be able to contribute to the assignment through the repository.


## Getting Started
Since the course is primarily using R as the programming language, unless otherwise practical, all group members should be using R version 3.4.4. Other programming languages may be used (especially in the data collection phase) as some APIs will not interact with R, but will interact with Java or Python.

### Use of Wiki
A wiki for this project has been set up to share knowledge across the group. All group members are expected to contribute to the wiki to produce documentation for the project including meeting minutes, discussion topics, code snippets and documentation and key milestones/decisions.

### Project Management & Communication
Communication will be conducted through student email, a private slack channel for the group, and in person. If you do not have access to the group slack channel or student email, consult another group member. Project management tasks will be undertaken using GitHub Projects - please lookup how Kanban task management works. 
We will use an scrum model of running four 1 week sprints.
Scheduled catchups
Monday (1/2 hr) - Sprint planning -> outline goals to achieve for that week and break it down into tasks
Friday (1/2 hr) - Sprint Demo/Retrospective -> Demo what we've done to each other, and discuss how we can improve for next sprint
Standups can be done ad-hoc, please check-in slack on demand to update each other.
