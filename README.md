# Assignment-2

## What is this repository for?
This repository is for the major group work for Statistical Thinking for Data Science for the Master of Data Science & Innovation at UTS. All group members should be able to contribute to the assignment through the repository.


## Getting Started
Since the course is primarily using R as the programming language, unless otherwise practical, all group members should be using R version 3.4.4. Other programming languages may be used (especially in the data collection phase) as some APIs will not interact with R, but will interact with Java or Python. 

### Group Members

### Use of Wiki
A wiki for this project has been set up to share knowledge across the group. All group members are expected to contribute to the wiki to produce documentation for the project including meeting minutes, discussion topics, code snippets and documentation and key milestones/decisions.

### Project Management & Communication
* We will use an scrum model of running four 1 week sprints.

* Informal communication (messaging, on-demand collaboration) will be done through a private slack channel.

* A skype meeting will be carried out on sunday (1 hr) for Sprint planning -> outline goals to achieve for that week and break it down into tasks

* Another skype meeting will be carried out on Fridays (1/2 hr) - Sprint Demo/Retrospective -> Demo what we've done to each other, and discuss how we can improve for next sprint

* The team will also meet on monday evenings as part of drop in sessions to swarm on tasks for the week.

* Project management tasks will be undertaken using GitHub Projects - please lookup how Kanban task management works. 

* Standups can be done ad-hoc, please check-in slack on demand to update each other.

# Data Sets

## Listings
The listings data set contains data about the AirBnB listings. There are 32,830 records in this data set. This data set includes descriptions of the listing, features about the listing, for example, amenities and number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and ratings of the property.

## Reviews
This data set contains all of the text reviews of each of the properties.

## Calandar
This data set contains data around whether or not the property is available on a particular date.

## Opera House by Transport
This data set contains the time in seconds and the distance in meters between the listing and the sydney opera house when catching public transport (more landmarks to come).
