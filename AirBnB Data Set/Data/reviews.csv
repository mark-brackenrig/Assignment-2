Tat patiently answered our questions as a local and showed us how to get around and where to go. What a great experience!! His home were as  the pictures, clean, comfortable and convenient. Surrey Hills was such a beautiful, conveniently located heritage area. I highly recommend Tat place. It is hard to beat for convenient location, great host and nice beautiful heritage area."
11399407,64943430,2016-03-09,13329247,Ashok,"Tat was extremely helpful before my arrival and then very hospitable and friendly while I was there. The room was lovely and the bathroom was great. The house overall is extremely well done having been recently renovated - so it made the stay very very easy. The location was great for what I wanted so I could go off and do things during the day, return for a rest and then go out for the evening - and it was within walking distance of everywhere I wanted to go which made it fantastic. This was a wonderful stay and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone else :-)"

11399407,70037262,2016-04-15,54714006,Kristel,My stay at Tat's place was great. The neighbours were a bit loud but that wasnt a big deal. The house itself is lovely and lovingly renovated so everything was very clean and well looked after so it was a very comfortable place to stay. Would definitely recommend and stay again myself (I didn't really want to leave!)
11399407,70671338,2016-04-19,60704478,Yan Bin,"The location is about an 8 min walk to central stn. And it was also walking distance to crown street where many of the good cafes are located.

11399407,71018559,2016-04-22,26022705,Luciana,"I had a really good time at Tat's place. The location is just perfect as I was in the Sydney CBD for interviews. It took me 30 minutes to walk to my interview locations or just a few minutes by train from Tat's place. 
The house is beautifully decorated, including my room and bathroom. I slept really well as the place is extremely silent in the evenings. I am happy as I passed on the interviews :) and I look forward to stay there again once I go for my apartment hunting in Sydney in the next month. Thanks Tat for providing such a beautiful, peaceful and well located place which made me relax and succeed :)"
11399407,71662138,2016-04-27,1311297,Muna,"I throughly loved my stay here. The house was bright and cheerful,  and conveniently located, and my room was comfortable and spotlessly clean. I really felt at home here. Tat is a terrific host deserving of his Super Host status. He really does thinks of everything. He wasn't here when I arrived but his friends were. When I did meet Tat I found him to be warm, friendly and incredibly helpful. He had maps, guidebooks, lots of great suggestions and even lent me his Opal card for getting around. The neighbourhood is a brilliant place to be in, with lots of fabulous cafes and restaurants, supermarkets and convenience stores and just a few minutes walk from the train station and bus stops. Getting to the key sights was a cinch. I'd highly recommend a stay here and would love to come back."
11399407,73274908,2016-05-07,41606656,Marit,"Very warm welcome by Tat with explanation of what to do and see around Sydney. Clean, recently renovated home with all facilities you need for a comfortable stay. Location is convenient, close to Central station and the hip streets of Surry Hills. Everything you could wish for during your stay! Minor inconvenience has been a little noise from a neighbors' party during one night."
11399407,73770454,2016-05-10,34101188,Victor,Tat is a great host. I am definitely going to stay at Tat's place if I visit Sydney again.

Tat is very friendly and excels in making his guests feeling welcome! He went out of his way to help me as I was looking to rent a property in Sydney. He gave me a lift and great hints on the rental market. In addition, his place is always so clean, beautifully decorated, quiet and in a very good location. 
Staying there proved the spirit of Airbnb that ""A stranger is just a friend I haven't met yet""!"

11399407,92849132,2016-08-10,24271492,YeRim,"I loved staying at Tat's place. To begin with, he was eager to help you at all times and very friendly. Also, his place was impeccably clean and modern. The bed and beddigs were perfect and soft, so even though it was kinda chilly in the morning and the night, I didn't feel any cold. The location was also nice. It was close to bus stations. You could reach the station in 7 minutes. I would love to stay Tat's place again."

11399407,109035972,2016-10-18,6728171,Adorra,"Tat's place is beautiful! Even though Tat wasn't in, checking in was a breeze and efficient. His friend who received us at home was very helpful giving us directions to the nearest Coles and eateries. We had the room with the ensuite and it was definitely one of the best rooms to have. The toilet and room was clean. Scratch that, the entire house is clean and in excellent order. We had a good stay at Tat's. Location is a good and well surrounded with nice restaurants and etc. Highly recommended to stay at Tat's!"
11399407,110227627,2016-10-24,89502957,Faye,"Unfortunately we did not get to meet Tat throughout our stay but he was still incredibly helpful and informative and always quick to respond with any queries you may have. 

Tat was very knowledgable about the area,giving us great advice in terms of transportation and things to do in Sydney. We were originally meant to be staying in a double room but was swapped for the Studio at no extra charge which was a great surprise to us as we then had our very own private living area. The studio was small but perfect for couples,modern and bright and impeccably clean. Everything you need is there including toiletries and towels,you can also do your washing which is convenient for anyone travelling onwards to another destination. 

The studio is a five minute walk to Central station which is extremely easy to use and gets you into the main city centre in no time at all. Surrey Hills is obviously more of a surburban area as some parts can be a little 'rough round the edges' but nonetheless it felt safe and we had no further issues. 

This was our first time in Sydney and using Air BnB and overall it was an excellent experience. We would happily use Tat and the studio again, we'd like to thank him for hosting us and making our holiday stress free and extremely comfortable. 

Faye & Chris"
11399407,111019811,2016-10-29,96438183,John,Had a great stay at Tat home. Nice bedroom with toilet and bath room. Great dinning room share with flatmate. Tat was on the trip and Nicco helps to settle down and he is helpful.

11399407,113283792,2016-11-11,36836637,黎明,"感谢Tat提供的住宿,强烈推荐大家入住Tat家:
1.位置绝佳,距离CBD走路10分钟,在悉尼玩了五天,每天起来散散步就走到市中心了。房子在Surryhill的保留区,闹中有静,距离Coles超市和药房走路5分钟,给国内亲戚带东西直接拎回来就好了。
2.房间干净整洁,床很舒服,独立的卫生间,洗澡很方便。厨房里的设施也很齐全。
3.Tat可以讲流利的汉语,这对于我这种英语不好的人来说简直太幸福了。和他聊天超级有意思。
4.Tat随时都准备好给我提供需要的帮助,我是去考试的,忘记打准考证,Tat上楼两分钟就给我打好了,还是彩色的噢:)    临行前下午,我担心走的太早打不到车,Tat还帮叫了Uber。
总之超级推荐啦,Tat是个非常有趣而且有魅力的家伙,希望下次去悉尼还可以住Tat家~~"

11399407,116692343,2016-12-02,98164143,Clairexin,"Tat is a very hospitable and friendly host. He gave us a very warm welcome upon reaching his house. He gave detail orientation, provide maps to us and also recommend us lots of food suggestions (those that often visited by locals and not just tourists :D). He also borrowed us the opal Travelling card. 

The location is convenient. Walkable distance to lots of nice Chinese restaurant, famous cafe like bourke street bakery, Devon cafe.

The entire house is very clean (especially the toilet) and trendy. We felt very relax and free when staying at his house.  

On the last day when we forgot to return the room key to Tat, he offer to make his way to get keys from us instead of asking us to go back. He is indeed a very helpful host. 

I will highly recommend Tat's house to anyone that is going to Sydney. Definitely will stay back his house again! ☺️"
11399407,117249099,2016-12-05,67822533,Emilie,"Whilst my stay at Tat's home was brief, it was brilliant. As a design lover I was super pleased with the fitout of my bedroom and shared spaces like the livingroom and dining areas. The space overall was clean and simple with a touch of flair. Tat was warm and welcoming, always happy to have a chat and assist with questions, but respectful of space too. The apartment is in a good spot, close to public transport and with a convenience store and places to eat just a short stroll away. I would highly recommend Tat's home to anyone looking to stay in Surry Hills."

Very comfortable room and loved the en-suite facility.    We had some very good conversations and in each of the 3 airbnbs in Australia art has been a big feature of conversations.... Thanks again for being a great host.   kind regards Mark
11399407,122194134,2016-12-21,44350170,Felicia,Tat is an awesome host ! He actually cooked the Chinese tang yuan right at his place to celebrate the festive day together. Fantastic! I stayed at his place twice (loved the first stay) as the place was really convenient to get anywhere and it was really clean and quiet for a great night rest. Can't say more. Highly recommended!

11399407,137506650,2017-03-15,104378738,Ania,"Cosy room, fantastic location, superb host. If you plan to spend time inside, the room might be a bit small for your taste. Travelling with a baby, we were fine-and Tat has a great open kitchen/lounge space. All in all the perfect spot for a few days in Sydney!"
11399407,138076026,2017-03-18,90771938,Catharina,"Tat ist ein sehr sympathischer und freundlicher Gastgeber. Er ist sehr hilfsbereit und hat super Tipps zur Orientierung in Sydney oder zu Ausflügen gegeben. Das Haus von Tat ist großartig, die Ausstattung ist modern und stylisch. Genau wie mein Gästezimmer mit eigenem Bad! Alles ist sehr sauber, hell und geräumig. Das Bett ist sehr bequem, Wifi hat einwandfrei funktioniert. Klimaanlage ist vorhanden, habe ich allerdings nicht benötigt. Ich habe mich bei Tat sehr wohl gefühlt und würde jederzeit wiederkommen."
11399407,138853788,2017-03-21,18271810,Brian,"Quiet but centrally located apartment ideal for couples looking for a home away from home. Extremely clean and excellently ran by tat, who will help you with anything you need. Perfect for surry hills and also close to central station for getting further afield."
11399407,139317809,2017-03-24,114835355,Aamir,"Tat is a great host with a detailed knowledge of Sydney. He helped plan the itinerary and recommended the best restaurants. 

Tat's house is clean, well decorated and comfortable. The ensuite room allows privacy and is extremely neat and clean. 

The area behind Tat's house seems to be low cost housing. But I did not feel unsafe. 

Overall my stay was wonderful."

11399407,141393371,2017-04-02,1298636,Stefanie,"Tat was an amazing host that left us with good memories of our time in Sydney. He welcomed us warmly the moment we stepped foot into his cosy apartment, of which is really nicely done up and looks just like the pictures. He gave us many great tips about getting around, recommendations of good food around the area etc

The room we got was just nice for 2 and I loved how the shower had a good run of hot water - not those that have slight surges of cold water in between showers. As a female traveler, I was more than happy to see a hairdryer and even make up remover wipes stored in the bathroom.

The neighborhood is quiet with a good mix of cafes and restaurants nearby. Getting around to tourist spots from his apartment is not difficult at all.

Overall, Tat deserves 11/10 stars as a host! I have seen him cleaning the apartment himself so you can expect his place to be absolutely spick and span. Will definitely stay again if I am back in Sydney. Thanks Tat!"
11399407,142994065,2017-04-09,47978651,Heidi,"Tat is the perfect host; welcoming and helpful, he made time to help me navigate around Sydney, and is always happy to chat over a nice cuppa. His house is walking distance to Central, and is in a quiet and safe neighbourhood. His home is spacious and clean, and feels so cosy. The availability of an en suite makes it worth every cent. During my stay, he even made muffins, which he shared with his guests. Next time I visit Sydney, I'll definitely be checking whether Tat's rooms are available first."

He also gave us great recommendations on restaurants, things to see, places to go etc. He even made banana muffins which he left our on the table for us to enjoy (which were delicious!). We also spent some time sitting and chatting with Tat.. which we very much enjoyed. He is very well travelled and just a world of information! The location of the property is excellent. About a 8 minute walk from central station which will take you anywhere you need to go in Sydney! The room itself was spotless.. The bed was comfortable and there was great wifi. Similarly, the bathroom was extremely clean and modern. We would definitely return to stay with Tat. Many thanks!"

Beyond that, Tat is very friendly and gave a good overview of all of the tourism destinations and how to get to those places. He was usually around at night, making it easy to ask him questions in person. The bedroom has its own lock, so there's no reason to worry about leaving things there even when there's a guest in the second room. With the private bathroom attached the bedroom, staying here is as comfortable as living at home. Highly recommend!"

11399407,218450460,2017-12-12,157172547,Irina,"Tat is a wonderful host, very attentive to detail and ready to help out. His place is wonderfully cozy, new and has everything you might need. It is a bit of a walk from the Circular Quay, which is the touristic centre of Sydney, but you can always catch a bus or a taxi if you need a ride. I personally got to know Sydney much better thanks to the walk I had to take from Tat’s place to the Circular Quay.

Тат - замечательный хозяин, очень внимательный к деталям и готовый помочь. Его дом очень уютный, со свежим ремонтом, и в нем есть все необходимое. Дом расположен далековато от Circular Quay, туристического центра и главного причала паромов Сиднея, но если Вы не готовы идти пешком, всегда можно доехать на автобусе или такси. Лично мне прогулки до центра подарили отличную возможность лучше познакомиться с городом и увидеть все значимые достопримечательности по пути."

We love staying at her home which is home away from home for us.  It is convenient to our family and friends and great shopping centres.  Over the years we have even became quite aquainted with the lovely neighbours who are also the nicest of people.  On
this occassion we had the front 2bedroom house which was perfect for my growing girls who need their own space.  Having the extra space and full kitchen was great and I even managed to bake on a few occassions.  Look forward to returning to Mary's cosy home on our next annual visit.  Thank you Mary"

9827619,102331479,2016-09-17,84593014,Kim,"""Cosy Cottage"" was the perfect fit for me for my 2 week stay.  Everything Mary had detailed was accurate and the area really is as quiet as stated.  Mary's contact was very prompt and during my stay was respectful and considered, checking that everything was ok.  I arrived late at night (Mary even recommended trains etc) and was waiting for me to explain the amenities, including a much appreciated breakfast for my early start the following morning!  I would highly recommend ""Cosy Cottage"" if you are looking for a home away from home."

The place was clean and well equiped.
Mary was keen to have suggestions as to how to improve the listing further.
Quiet area close to shops and public transport."
9827619,121924671,2016-12-19,106095271,Ihab,"Our stay at Mary's was absolute pain relief after 24 hours flight from overseas. The fridge was filled with fruits, bread, jam and milk, that was really generous from her. And when she knew that we were trying to find a longer stay accommodation, she guided us through lot's of where-abouts. She really made us feels we are welcomed, and we do believe we earned her as our first friend in Sydney. The Airbnb described this home as a rare find, and sure it is. The house is furnished from a - z, clean, comfortable. Suitable for small family, you will find nice toys for your kidz to play with.

The location is really near from 2 different lines of transportation, one towards Macquaire area and the other towards down town. Train stations also not that far if you intend to reach far districts. Buses should take 5 mins to Top Ryde and Macquaire shopping centers. Midway Shopping center is 5 mins walking from the door. The neighborhood is really quite..

9827619,122322718,2016-12-22,49899805,David,Mary was a lovely host who introduced herself to give us the lay of the land then gave us our privacy.

We found we were also able to easily park a car outside and the location allowed us to explore Lane Cove National Park and the Northern beaches which was ideal. 
We found the house to be equipped with everything we needed and were very comfortable. The house is very cosy and homely; we'd love to stay again!"

Mary met us on arrival and helped us to settle in. She then retired to her section of the house and left us to enjoy our stay.

8957151,75591742,2016-05-22,31201604,Julia,"This place is one of the nicest spots I have ever stayed in through Air B n B. Firstly, we were warmly greeted by a friend of Agnes at the beginning of our stay who provided the keys and gave us the grand tour of the apartment. A really lovely feature of this place is that it is an old hospital. The suburb itself has some rich history which we found interesting to explore.
Once greeted, we were take away by the view. We didn't see any whales but I'm told they do swim past at this time of year. 
We found the apartment clean and homely. Agnes is a lovely artist and the place was furnished and decorated beautifully.
If you do stay here, a car would be preferable. We found it easy to access the airport, city and surrounding beaches with our car and the on-street parking was very easy - there were always plenty of spots for us to park.
Agnes was very kind with letting us check out late which was greatly appreciated. 
This is a spot that doesn't feel like you are in Sydney! It is truly a holiday retreat. Highly recommended, would stay again in a heartbeat."
8957151,78247573,2016-06-06,73832673,Paige,"Beautifully decorated, tidy apartment with an amazing view. The birds nest was amazing,although the weather was terrible I couldn't have been happier staying here. Very friendly and accommodating thank you Agnes!"

I felt welome and at home, with tea and coffee available and pantry items also (use/replace, perfect). The apartment is beautifully furnished and the view is wonderful."
8957151,96630670,2016-08-23,53915575,Alistair,Agnes was herself on holiday when we arrived but she had organised a great welcome from Garry who acted on her behalf.  The Nest is just a wonderful place and indeed Little Bay is a fantastic setting.  The facilities and of course the view from the apartment are first class.  We especially loved having breakfast on the balcony whist watching the whales swim by.  There are great places to eat nearby and if you are a golfer then you have 4 courses to choose from on your doorstep.  Highly recommended as a home from home and place to stay.  Many thanks to Agnes (and Garry)
8957151,97852197,2016-08-28,84037083,Melita,It was amazing. I loved the nest with spectacular views.

My mom love Agnes's apartment so much. We can see the sea and golf club every morning, these makes my mom feel really relax. Everything is so great. I can't find any places that I'm not satisfied!!! I would highly recommend her apartment and next time my mom came to Sydney, I would like to book Agnes's nest again:)"

It is really close to the beach, only about a 10 minute walk, and driving distance to shops. Agnes made it really easy to check in and we felt very looked after. Great communication and a beautiful place to stay. Can't wait to come back again!"

Not only was she there to welcome us on the arrival and shown us everything that we need to know, she is also a host  with a lot of love and care. My dog has heart problems  that needs medication so we need to bring him with us on the trip, and Agnes allowed him to stay. He had a really great time!  The location is amazing and the apartment is very stylish and has a beautiful seaview.  Everything is very clean and well organised. It makes our stay an awesome experience!!  I highly recommend it!! 

We will definitely be back when we visit Sydney next time!! Thanks again Agnes!!"
8957151,135368565,2017-03-04,46702036,April,"The Nest was absolutely stunning and perfect for our 5-day stay in the Sydney area. Little Bay is so quaint - and has a few very nice restaurants - everyone was so kind. We also ventured to a nearby beach and had a beautiful Thai lunch in La Perouse - highly recommend a visit there.  Agnes was lovely and communication was a breeze leading up to our trip. She greeted us at The Nest and was so kind and showed us how everything worked. The apartment is gorgeous and has unique, artistic touches - it was even more beautiful than the photos and has a peaceful energy. My boyfriend and I felt so cosy here. And the views!!! Sunrises were are delight on the patio and we cooked a few meals in the evening, sat on the patio and watched the sea and sky. Highly recommend a stay here - it was just the peaceful retreat we were looking for. Merci beaucoup, Agnes!"

The views are phenomenal. I loved how the nest is very close to several stores nearby, and is very secure. I highly recommend Agnes's place, and she is a reliable host. Agnes is very good at responding your questions, and will help you in whatever way she can. I'll definitely come back!"
8957151,185147143,2017-08-21,140373117,Paul,"If you like golf, walks in the bush, peace and quiet, then this is the place for you.  We missed having a TV to watch our favourite football team.
Agnes is a wonderful host and her ""nest"" is just perfect for a relaxing getaway."

Shann wasn't at home what was no big problem because she was reachable 24/7. Only bad thing was that there are two cats at the moment which I didn't know and their hair were everywhere (f.exp: bedsheets, couch)"
6417587,223846375,2018-01-01,2680915,Ellen,"Best stay we ever had! Super clean, super quiet and still right next to Bondi beach and the bus stop to the city center! Nicest house mates ever and the whole house interior is picked with love for details! You immediately feel like home!!! we would come back anytime!!!"
13519188,125628468,2017-01-06,99167335,Fabia,"We would most definitly stay here again and recommend this apartment to couples, perfect location we loved staying in North Bondi. A little noisey at night w mini bus terminal outside and street traffic but we got used to this. There was a lock box around the corner of the building to leave keys, It was a bit of a pain only having one key esp w myself and partner not having a working sim for mobile communication. Minor details, all and all thank you for accommodating us!"
13519188,151078413,2017-05-11,95269028,Tom,"We went to this great apartment for 6 days. The location was great with a nice view to the beach. The Apartment is just 10sec away from the next bus stop to Bondi Junction Station from where you also can go by train in the CBD. All in all, its an about 40min ride to be in the CBD. The bus is going nearly 24h. 
We really enjoyed the time and say thank you Sarah!"

3598289,19055192,2014-09-05,15941442,Hollie,"We had a fantastic time staying with Leigh and her family. From the moment we arrived we felt welcomed and at home. Nothing was too much trouble for Leigh or her husband Martin. We also really enjoyed chatting with both of them during our time there, and getting to know them.  

Leigh and Martin's son is also lovely. We barely heard him - equally as relaxed and welcoming as his parents!

The bedroom and living room are very private, quiet and comfortable. The large array of dvds and board games are also brilliant. 

The area is amazing. Only a 5 minutes drive to gorgeous Manly where you can catch a ferry to the city (a great tourist experience in itself), and even closer to the centre of Freshwater which has everything you could need. 

We highly recommend Leigh and Martin's place. Great place,  great people and great stay!"
3598289,21382079,2014-10-16,10628838,Sadie,"I had such a fantastic time staying in Freshie with Leigh, Martin, the absolutely gorgeous Charlie (who sleeps likes no other child I've ever met, and I have two of my own!), and their 2 adorable cats :)  I was made to feel welcome from the moment I walked in the door.  Both Leigh and Martin went out of their way to make sure that I wanted for nothing.  And Leigh even dropped me off to my destination one day due to the rainy morning - so generous.  The neighbourhood and beach is spectacular!!  I used to live in Sydney but have never been here, and now want to MOVE there!  No need for me to visit the bustling city, I much preferred the pace of this cute beach, the cafes and shops.  The room was more than comfortable and it was lovely having my own little space downstairs to chill out when I was just too exhausted to do anything else :)  I have absolutely no doubt that if I ever visit this area again - I will be most definitely looking up these guys - thank you so much!!"
3598289,21794452,2014-10-24,21875561,Gaynor,This was my first trip with airbnb and I didn't really know what to expect! All I can say is that Leigh and her family made it a great first experience and one I would repeat and certainly recommend.From the moment I got there they made me feel at home and were so helpful and friendly. my only regret was that I wasn't able to stay for longer!
3598289,22156526,2014-10-31,22386077,Ben,"Host made both my mother very welcome. Was very happy to be able to find a comfortable and friendly place for my mum to stay . 

"
3598289,22524114,2014-11-09,3480732,Claudia,"I stayed at Leigh and Martin's house for few days and enjoyed it very much. They are a very friendly and helpful family. Their baby is already a little boy, a nice boy, and the cats are very cute. From this place, you can walk very easy to the beach, and there is a bus to Manly straight on this street.
Thanks for having a nice time, Claudia"
3598289,23007174,2014-11-20,21817226,Romain,"My Mum and sister stayed for 4 nights , Leigh and her husband were so nice and make you feel like home.
It was a good experience for my Mum and Sister from France."
3598289,23311300,2014-11-28,8662830,Sarah,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay! Leigh and her family were so friendly and accommodating from the second we met them. They made us feel instantly at home, and we're just lovely to talk with.  We really lived the small town of Freshwater- the main square was a few mins walk, and though a small town, it was quite concentrated with cute cafes and such, and the awesomely charming town of Manly was an easy bus ride away. We'd love to return to stay with Leigh in Freshwater again!"
3598289,25279648,2015-01-11,24919063,Susanne,"We had functions to attend in Freshwater Beach on the weekend so our accommodation was perfect and our hosts were very welcoming, friendly and helpful. We recommend this B&B."
3598289,26964647,2015-02-22,22943728,Marie,"Where do begin with this place!  Perhaps with the beautiful iconic leafy Northern Beaches suburban street, a short 10 minute stroll to the beachside, Freshwater town centre and easy street parking right out front.  We were welcomed before we even arrived by great communication from Leigh, and upon arrival we had a tour of our areas and met two sweet kitties (and a cute little boy).  The space for guests is super nice, with a bookshelf filled with movies, interesting books and a flatscreen TV with DVD player.  There's a super comfy couch to chill on.  Up the stairs is a super cute attic-turned-bedroom with fresh bedding and towels, and even a personalised welcome note waiting on the bed.  There's also a TV and DVD upstairs, with another couch and air conditioning to counter the steamy Sydney nights.  Our evening consisted of swimming in the beautiful inground pool, enjoying an oven baked pizza and some red wine, and crashing out early in the comfortable bed (which included ample fluffy pillows).  There was a little info booklet telling us all we needed to know, and we felt we could comfortably contact our hosts if need be.

If you love cats, this is the place for you - but even if you don't, you can shut the door to your private area and keep them on the outside!  The bathroom is lovely and lightfilled, and the shower/bath is more than big enough with complementary hotel style bathroom products to use if you forget something!  

All in all, Leigh and Martin were the perfect hosts, kind, friendly and super genuine people.  It was a joy to share their house for the night, and we wouldn't hesitate to do so again!"
3598289,27208581,2015-02-28,26346829,Amanda,Leigh and Martin were very welcoming and easy going. Love the cats
3598289,27665203,2015-03-09,4028111,Carrie,"Leigh & Martin were extremely friendly and welcoming when we arrived at the property in Freshwater. The property is located in a quiet tree lined street, the bedroom is small but perfectly adequate for what we needed there is also a small private lounge area with TV, the shower room/toilet is shared with the family but this wasn't a problem. The bedroom has a quiet air-con which we were grateful for as it was quite hot when we stayed there. Breakfast was included in the cost and there was plenty to choose from yoghurts/cereals (although you might have to fight Martin for the Frosties!! haha) toast/croissants/marmalades/jams & plenty of tea or coffee. There is also a pool out the back which unfortunately we didn't have time to use & the lovely Freshwater beach is a short walk away. Overall we had a very short but pleasant stay with a lovely family."

3598289,60797721,2016-01-27,37835208,Jace,"Leigh and her family are the most incredible hosts. Such a warm and welcoming atmosphere. They go above and beyond to make sure that your stay is outstanding (breakfast included, fresh towels, soaps, etc...). The room is a very private upstairs bedroom with your very own downstairs TV room. The location is about as good as it gets. A short walk to the Freshwater restaurants, Freshwater Beach, and Curl Curl. The best part of this beach pad, though, is Leigh and her family. They are welcoming, warm, kind, considerate, and understanding of a travelers needs. We would stay here again in a heart beat."

It was true to the web posting in all regards, and suited us very well for a pleasant week in a lovely harbourside position handy to both a vibrant local community and with easy access to the city centre - both by bus and ferry. A bonus was the local bus (3 times/hr and air conditioned) which went through the city centre to the Art Gallery of NSW. The easiest of journeys.
The WiFi worked well as did travel to and from the airport ($65 each way by cab).
Our accommodation had just been upgraded and it met our needs well.
Ilka was everything a host should be ... easy to get on with, helpful with regard to our interests and an intersting person.
We happily commend this lovely self contained apartment.

It was like living in a magazine ! We felt really comfortable, the beds were great, the kitchen had everything we needed. We could even use the washing machine ! Lynsey is very thoughtful, she left a cute note on the fridge for us and fresh flowers in the kitchen ! The neighborhood is great and safe and the bus station was just around the corner. It took us about 15-20 minutes to get to the city depending on traffic. I could not expect a better stay to finish our journey in Australia. Highly recommend it !"

16380654,139141354,2017-03-23,112830489,Alexander,"Mengjun was the best host I ever had !

He is an extremely friendly man and knows what to do that you feeling good.
If there is a problem you can text him and he comes down to check it and fix it. Really great!!

The accommodation was absolutely clean and tidy.
The room is bigger than he looks at the pictures and it's a nice place to stay for one or two persons.

And if you open the door to the terrace, you will get a flash by the wonderful view about the valley. The pool is big and it's a really great spot to chill and enjoy the sun if you don't want to go to beach.

In the end, the accommodation is the really best I ever had! The price is really fair and it isn't a problem to go to city by bus. 

I wish I can stay there, if I need, another time:) 
"
16380654,139918765,2017-03-26,6187873,Anne,Mengjun's son was very pleasant.  We appreciated the good bed and the views but it didn't seem a comfortable place to stay in - maybe better chairs would help.

She even took the time to walk us up the street to Edgcliff where there were grocery and wine shops. The views of the city and the harbor from the apartment were amazing! We walked to Darling Point and the Paddington district where there were a ton of shops and restaurants. Took Uber to tour the Sydney Opera House and the ferry to Manly Beach. This is a nice central location to experience the sights of the city.
17799117,177464943,2017-08-03,42963803,Omeid,Lilly was a fantastic host.  She was very responsive and her place was very clean and spacious. I absolutely enjoyed waking up to the view of bay in the morning!

Railway station and a supermarket just up the road and a good Indian restaurant about 300 metres away. Car stacking arrangement worked well for us but no good for four wheeled drives.
17799117,181495229,2017-08-13,85363963,Martha,"I loved Lilly's apartment.  The unit is bright, clean, comfortable, and cozy. Has a full equipped kitchen with in- unit washer/dryer.  Water pressure and temperature were perfect.  Wi- fi also excellent. The building is safe and well maintained. Lilly was super nice and flexible as I needed to leave my bags few hours after check-out.  She is very responsive, friendly and respectful. I wished I could have stayed longer.  The view from the balcony is so amazing! Just as pictured, you can see Sydney’s CBD in one side and the Bay and Rushcutters Bay Park on the other side. Location is great and 5 min. from the Edgecliff train and bus stop is right at the door. This was the best Airbnb location and host I had in Sydney (and Melbourne). Lilly is a fantastic host and helped me with all sorts of questions I had! thank you Lilly for all your guidance and patience.  I hope to come back soon!"
17799117,184488892,2017-08-19,71784122,Nosiku,Definitely would recommend staying here. Light filled apartment close to shops and transport. Lilly is a great host and communicator!
17799117,186198030,2017-08-24,58128614,Douglas,"Good communication with Lilly.  Her Mum met us and she was absolutely charming and she checked us in and showed us how the 'Car Stacker' worked.  That's half the reason I chose this place just to experience one.  City and Bay view from the unit is awesome!!!  It's 1 block to Rushcutters Bay promenade where there are spectacular views of The Opera House and Harbour Bridge.  Great location to the city, train and grocery stores.  It's a busy 6 lane road out front so bring your earplugs.  Unfortunately the mattress was very uncomfortable.  The springs dug into our bones and we had a terrible nights sleep so on the 2nd night we put the lounge cushions on the bed.  Once the host invests in a proper mattess I would recommend this listing."
17799117,187900834,2017-08-28,102158453,Karen,"Lily's place is really great. Very clean and very comfortable. Lily is an excellent host and communication with her was first rate. Lovely views and quality furnishings at the apartment. Thanks for everything Lily, we will be returning soon."
17799117,188841944,2017-08-31,128718231,D,"This apartment has wonderful views of Sydney and a great location with access to train and bus at your doorstep. Its also right across the street from beautiful Rushcutters bay park. Apartment is equipped with all amenities, and is very comfy and well organized.

17799117,195012647,2017-09-18,147836187,Ben,"Great location, outside the CBD but in easy reach by bus or (with a short walk) train. Fantastic view from the lounge room over the city and Rushcutter bay. I'm happy to recommend this place to others."
17799117,195555517,2017-09-19,4021162,Nick,"I had a great stay at Lilly's apartment. Super easy to get around and a very clean and neat place to be for a couple of days.

17799117,198029685,2017-09-28,89278268,Jimmy,风景很好
17799117,200851614,2017-10-06,15712883,Alec,"This apartment is a fantastic location. It has great views of Rushcutters bay park and the harbor, with a big terrace to sit on and enjoy the view. It is also north facing with big windows so it is light filled and airy (but with good curtains).

Only thing to consider about this property is that it is on a very busy main road and there is significant traffic noise at most times of the day and night (we easily dealt with this using ear plugs). Also Lilly clearly states the size restrictions on cars for parking, please pay close attention to these as they are not flexible

Lilly is a fabulous host, she was extremely responsive to several requests throughout our stay, getting back to us immediately and helping in any way she could."
17799117,202107364,2017-10-10,18872453,Klaudia,Such a great apartment! Beautiful view and greatly furnished :) Lilly and her co-host were very quick to respond and both very lovely and accommodating :) Would love to stay here again!
17799117,202347612,2017-10-11,146067574,Lana,Lovely clean place although was not aware the apartment was right next to a train line. Traffic noise tolerable however the train was quite loud. View was fantastic and location was very convenient. Was a little disappointed the bed sheets had not been ironed and made nicely.
17799117,202555795,2017-10-12,99000859,Sheree,Lilly's home was great. Very clean and tidy and in an ideal location. Also has a great view of the city. Would definitely recommend.
17799117,203046457,2017-10-14,108298581,Helen,"Great convenient place to stay, 5 mins to the station and short walk to meany eating places.  Coles only 7 mins walk.  Friendly Lilly met us to show us around the accommodation and was great at keeping in touch leading up the the stay. 
Make sure you take your own coffee as there was only a packet of instant cuppachino sachets with pre mixed sugar and some tea bags.  Milk was provided.  Really good value for such a central position. Thanks Lilly."
17799117,203300444,2017-10-14,149519882,Simon,Great place to stay. Very clean and comfortable and hosts where AMAZING and so accommodating.

17799117,205853087,2017-10-23,34613850,Eric,"Lilly was there on arrival and was friendly and helpful. Was lucky to have a brand new mattress. The apartment was beautifully and tastefully decorated, not forgetting the spectacular view of the Harbour and the city skyline. Comfortable bed and close to Edgecliff Station and just a few minutes drive to the city. Would stay again."
17799117,206324419,2017-10-25,106876737,Olivia,"Lilly's place was absolutely wonderful. It was clean, cosy and comfortable. Lilly had absolutely wonderful communication with us and made sure we arrived safely and had everything we needed, even though we weren't greeted by Lilly her mum Nancy was their to check us in. Nancy was absolutely delightful and made us feel at home when showing us around. Thank you so so much for hosting us, we definitely can't wait to be back and to stay with you again."
17799117,206536476,2017-10-26,31174979,Nicola,This is a great apartment. Lovely views of the city and water. Really clean and tidy and the bed was very comfy. Check in was easy and Lily was a great host and made sure everything was fine. It’s in a good location with only a few mins walk to the station or a short Uber/taxi ride into the city. Thanks for a great stay!
17799117,207797801,2017-10-30,20497545,Robin,This is our second visit and we just love it’s location and that it is warm and cosy. There is also a very good Indian restaurant just up the road. The only drawback is the traffic noise as we like to sleep with the windows open. We found that leaving only the balcony doors open and the bedroom window closed was best.
17799117,209226068,2017-11-04,21197886,Karen,"Great location within easy reach of the CBD yet surrounded by lots of greenery and bird Life! Very comfortable unit with great views and everything is supplied for eating in and relaxing. Lilly and her mum, Nancy were easy to contact and it was nice to be met and shown around. I’m not sure why people complain about the traffic noise as that’s just part of city living and if they don’t like it, why are they staying in the city?? Will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Sydney."
17799117,210164401,2017-11-07,121734662,Mike,The host canceled this reservation 31 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
17799117,210177632,2017-11-08,152838576,Janine,A great apartment close to Edgecliff station with a short commute into the city and Bondi Beach! Lilly was very helpful and quick to respond to any queries we had! A lovely place to stay!
17799117,212449889,2017-11-18,40058047,James,"We had an excellent time in Lilly's apartment. The views are spectacular, night and day, and the rooms are brightly decorated and well equipped. The position is exceptional being close to: beaches (especially Redleaf), bus and train links, an excellent Italian restaurant, the city and so much more. We loved our stay here and would certainly come back."
17799117,214133023,2017-11-24,116545054,Alexandra,"We stayed at Lilly's place for my 21st birthday. The location is ideal for getting into the city, we regularly caught the train as the station was minutes away. It's also very easy to get to the apartment from the airport. There's are plenty of shops and places to eat at close by. The apartment itself has a lovely view and has everything you could possibly need for your stay. It is really nicely decorated and we enjoyed our stay. Lilly was really helpful and always replied to messages quickly so the communication was brilliant. I would absolutely recommend the apartment to people! Thanks Lilly!"
17799117,215808505,2017-12-01,147598511,子嫻,"這是我來雪梨覺得最棒的一部分,Lilly的房子有絕佳的風景,可以看到海灣綠地和市景,即使什麼都不做,光是躺在沙發上或床上都是一種享受。
而且交通實在太便利了,樓下就有公車站牌,走一小段就到火車站和超市,不管是遊玩或採買都很方便。
這次感謝Lilly提供這麼棒的房子,讓我的澳洲行充滿美好的回憶!"

Furthermore, the place was clean and had all the necessary amenities, as described. Vanessa is a great host, always friendly and accommodating."

The view from the balcony was beautiful, and the location was quiet and safe. I would definitely stay here again. Although I only rented the room, it felt like I had the entire apartment to myself during the day while the host was out and about. I would definitely stay here again. The only downside is that it takes a bit of time to get into the city - around 35-50 minutes. But, taking the ferry from Rose Bay to Circular Quay was a delight in itself."
10506913,162443173,2017-06-21,49281811,Leah,The place is just as advertised. Wonderful location with a stunning view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and steps away from the beach. The sunset was gorgeous and Vanessa was a great host!

Vanessa is very relaxed and we had a crest time sipping wine and watching Netflix a couple of nights. You are made welcome the moment you step into her house. 

And then there is that amazing view. The pictures are absolutely accurate. The beach is only a few steps away with all amenities such as restaurants just around the corner. 

I took the ferry from the city and back. It’s only a very short easy walk to Venessas place from the ferry terminal.

The room is more than adequate and clean. 

I would go back anytime :)"
